Experts in Teamwork is a course where students from various disciplines are put together in a team to work on a project throughout the semester. For the course, our group worked on a VR game called Conductor Hero where the player takes the role of a Conductor in a fantasy environment. The development of this project has taught us the importance of working with tight schedules as well as provided experience with cross disciplinary teams. The project report for Conductor Hero contains the technical details and methods for how the game was developed as well as discussions around the decisions that led to the final product.
